Full Stack Project (JS/ React, Python /Flask Postgres and Google Maps API ) to compare Neighborhoods

This project is some sample code to demonstrate the interaction of multiple technologies into a full-stack application.

The application consist in a tool to compare information of two comminities (neighborhoods) from our awesome city.

The information was obtained from the data provided by open data available from the city of calgary site. 

As the multipoligon and points to draw the limits and center on the locations of the communities were in arcGis format,
I converted them with python to be google maps compatible 
Also I used the react component created by Tom Cheng to render them in my components, see  https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps )
